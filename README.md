# @ikilote/magma

Magma is a component library for my personal projects, because I don't want to copy/paste.

It will evolve mainly according to my projects. But people want to use it and help, no worries.

## Component

- Context-menu
    - List in options
    - Circle in options
- Dialog
- Tabs

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Publishing the library

```
npm run build:lib
npm run publish:lib
```

## Update Demo

```
npm run build:demo
```

## License

Like Angular, this module is released under the permissive MIT license. Your contributions are always welcome.
